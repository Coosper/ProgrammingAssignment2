# Library Management System

## Overview

This project is a console-based application developed for the Programming Fundamentals 2 course, focusing on implementing OOP concepts like Inheritance, Abstraction, and Polymorphism. It simulates a library system to manage different types of books. This application accounts for 45% of the overall grade for the module.

## Features

- **Book Management**: Handles seven types of books - Book, Fiction Book, NonFiction Book, Ebook, Traditional Book, Geography Book, and History Book.
- **Data Persistence**: Stores and retrieves book data in an XML file format.
- **OOP Design**: Demonstrates use of inheritance with a hierarchy of book classes.
- **Efficient Data Handling**: Utilizes collections like ArrayList and HashMap for managing books.
- **Interactive Console Interface**: A user-friendly menu for performing operations like adding, removing, and displaying books.
- **Robust Input Handling**: Incorporates `EasyScanner` and `EasyScannerInput` classes for error-checked user inputs.

## Technical Details

- **Language**: Java
- **Concepts**: OOP principles (Inheritance, Abstraction, Polymorphism), File I/O, Data Structures.
- **Classes**:
  - `Book` (Superclass)
  - `Ebook`, `TraditionalBook`, `FictionBook`, `NonFictionBook`, `GeographyBook`, `HistoryBook` (Subclasses)
  - `BookApi`, `Driver`, `Utilities` (Utility and Controller classes)
- **Interface**: `Reading` - Implements attributes and methods across the book hierarchy.
